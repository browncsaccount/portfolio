                <figcaption class="img-caption">I redesigned a website, making improvements to the usability, learnability, and memorability.</figcaption>
                <figcaption class="img-caption" style="margin-top: 1rem">Each year, my hometown puts on a film festival to showcase the art of our local filmmaking community. In high school, my friends and I visited the website for the Sacramento International Film Festival. We found it extremely confusing to navigate, thus, deterring us from wanting to attend or appreciate such a meaningful event. Considerable effort and time are put into hosting local film festivals, so for this reason, I chose to redesign this website. A user-friendly website is essential to encouraging both attendance and recognition for all the independent artists involved in the event.</figcaption>

                <figcaption class="img-caption">I observed real users interacting with a public interface at Brown University, The Beloved and Infamous Ratty Drink Kiosk, to create UX personas and storyboards. My objective was to determine if it is a usable and efficient interface.</figcaption>
                <figcaption class="img-caption" style="margin-top: 1rem">The Ratty Drink Kiosk is a beverage dispenser that allows users to select a myriad of drink options with the convenience of one centralized source. As seen to the right, at the initial screen, users can select their drink of choice by clicking on a bubble icon. The user will then be directed to a second screen where, if applicable, they can customize the flavor of their drink.</figcaption>

                <figcaption class="img-caption">I’ve always been tethered to place. Perhaps it is an innate part of me that harbors my identity and my own sense of belonging in the places I’ve lived in. As a young adult in university trying to find my niche in the world, I’ve been pulled to many different places. And I’ve considered many places home for periods of my life. But like many others, I am always pulled back to the geographical place where I grew up and formed my literal sense of self– my hometown. To say the least, I have a love hate relationship with home. But it’s where I grew up. And it shaped who I am.</figcaption>
                <figcaption class="img-caption" style="margin-top: 1rem">I've composed a soundscape as a love letter to my hometown and, fittingly, the people and memories I associate with it. In the composition, you’ll find conversations I’ve had with friends and family as well as past journal entries I wrote in high school. The link leads to bandcamp and the composition is to be published soon! </figcaption>
